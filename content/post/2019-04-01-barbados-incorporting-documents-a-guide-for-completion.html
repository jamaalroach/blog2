<p>It took me six months, numerous trips to CAIPO and venting my displeasure to the Deputy Registrar before I was finally successful in incorporating a company last year. The major issue being “errors” in the completion of the documents. Now I would have no complaints about having to correct errors of my making, the problem was that after fixing errors as instructed, new, never before pointed out errors kept being identified. After the experience I decided I would mock up specimens of the forms for anyone else who may be looking to self incorporate. Hopefully it saves you some time and frustration.</p>

<li><p>The full name used should be the same on all the documents including the attorney declaration. However Section 5 of the Notice of Directors Form has less character space than the other forms so you should use whatever version of your name fits in there.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not use abbreviations like “St.” or “Ave.” in the addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though it is not stated anywhere you will need to print your name above your signature on the Articles of Incorporation.</p></li>
